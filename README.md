## Overview

This repository accompanies a [Medium post on developing robust LLM-based applications](https://bowen-yang1335.medium.com/how-to-avoid-parser-errors-for-llm-based-applications-a305dcc8e567) and demonstrates an example of identifying animals using a Large Language Model (LLM). This dummy application predicts whether a described animal is a cat, dog, or turtle, focusing on avoiding parser errors and ensuring reliable performance.


## Installation

To set up the environment, install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain
pip install langchain_openai
pip install python-dotenv
```

## Setup

1. **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain your OpenAI API key and store it in a `.env` file:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your OpenAI Key>
    ```

## Usage

Refer to the [Medium post](https://bowen-yang1335.medium.com/how-to-avoid-parser-errors-for-llm-based-applications-a305dcc8e567) for a detailed step-by-step guide on how to use this repository to build the animal identification application.
